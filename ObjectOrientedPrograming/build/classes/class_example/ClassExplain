Class is a blueprint of Object.
Class is one type of Formula to create a object.
one class use to create a multiple object is call the a multiple student.

student

==> create 1 Student class so in this class have some property like
Student Name And Student RollNumber;

So Assign

String name;
int rollNumber;

==> Second one class create with Main method So in this main method 
Create A Object of A student Class.
like........===>As Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);


Syntax :

    Class_Name Object_Name=new Class_Name;

Ex-->  Student s1=new Student();

After create a object Use class Property with object.

ex--> s1.name=Deep;
      s1.rollNumber=123;


Note:

if Class file And Main File Create A same Packet so Not necessary  to write a import Statement,
it can fetch automatically class Property.

But Some time user Want's to use Another Package Class Property so You must to Write Import 
Statement on the top so Refer it And use it.
