so before i seen how to public private And friendly Access Modifire use.

public--> It is Access EveryWHere.

private--> its only access Within a class.

Default (Friendly) --> Its a access within a Packege.

But Another One Added.

Protected--> its is Access Not A Class Or Packege Only But Also it Access EveryWhere.


in normally name formate is like 
Deep BharatBhai darji
So First Assign a Chield name And Second one assign Parents name As In 
Access Specifire Write First Chield then parent

public class CarInherit extends vihical 

-->  CarInheritence is Chield,SubClass,Derived

-->  vihical is ParentClass,BaseClass,SuperClass

-->Super keyword.
When Some time Parent Function And Datatype use so Super Keyword to easyly Access it.

---->    super.print();
	
	So Automatically Super keyword throw print() function use.
